# Hash-Map

This repository contains a custom implementation of a HashMap data structure in JavaScript. The HashMap class supports common operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs, as well as methods to get all keys, values, and entries, and to clear the map.

# Features
Add Key-Value Pairs: Insert new key-value pairs and update existing keys.
Retrieve Values: Fetch values based on their keys.
Check Existence: Verify if a key exists in the map.
Remove Key-Value Pairs: Remove entries by key.
Map Length: Get the number of stored entries.
Clear Map: Remove all entries in the map.
Get All Keys: Retrieve an array of all keys.
Get All Values: Retrieve an array of all values.
Get All Entries: Retrieve an array of all key-value pairs.

# Skills Utilized
JavaScript ES6: Utilized modern JavaScript syntax and features for the implementation.
Data Structures: Applied knowledge of hash tables and their operations.
Algorithm Design: Implemented efficient algorithms for hashing, collision handling, and basic operations.
Problem Solving: Designed and tested various methods to ensure the correctness and performance of the HashMap.
